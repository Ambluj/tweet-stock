# Tweet-Stock
Tweet-Stock is a tool that allows users to evaluate associations between Twitter activity and stock price movement.

## Important Considerations
There are several factors that might be expected to influece the impacts that Twitter traffic may have on financial markets. For instance, the sentiment of Tweets relating to an entity should, in part, determine the *direction* of a price change.

Additionally, it is relevant to consider the role that Twitter may play as a *lagging indicator* of company performance. That is to say, while Tweets may not be an effective tool for forcasting markets (especially if Tweets are primarily in response to price changes), they might be usable as a proxy to indirectly impute the general trend of a company and its stock.
